# BLS-hottest-jobs-notebook
A pandas notebook to find the fastest-growing jobs in New Jersey

This is based on the BLS Occupational Employment and Wages Survey, a yearly survey of employers and workers. You can find the data source here: https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nj.htm

Run the "stitch" notebook first to create a generic dataset that compares between 2012 and 2018 (or whatever years you have downloaded). Then run the fastest notebook to find the top jobs. Keep in mind that a handful of jobs are new or have been dropped, so some may not line up perfectly.
